                <p>Scotland is one of the four countries that constitute the United Kingdom. It is the furtherst North country on the main isle of the UK, and is categorised by it's beautiful, hill filled countryside that is wonderful to explore. The hilly nature of the country is best shown in its many mountains that serve as amazing places to hike. The capital of Scotland is Edinburgh, and is a city with a huge amount of history, especially in sights like the Edinburgh Castle or the High street. There are a number of castles and palaces across Scotland in various states of disrepair. Some are amazingly taken care of, while others are little more than ruins. However, no matter the state, they all have a rich history that is amazing to learn.</p>
